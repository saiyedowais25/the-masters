=======================================================

Brand details:

What's inside:
- Expo-managed React Native project (App.js, screens, navigation)

- Build instructions for EAS or local Expo

Quick start (PC):
1. Extract the zip.
2. Open terminal in project folder.

If you want me to create the APK for you: add collaborator `themasters-helper` in Project Settings → Access/Collaborators.
